## Other Resources
[The Whole Story of the Bible in 16 Verses](https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Story-Bible-16-Verses-ebook/dp/B00QSNFYFO/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1624302293&sr=8-2)

This book does an exceptional job telling the whole story of the Bible and it's still really short. It's great because it lets you "read ahead" and understand what you read better.
