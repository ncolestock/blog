# One Suggestion for Personal Devotions

## What Should I Read?

1. Read a small section from any book of the Bible that you are excited about. Ask, "What would benefit my personal communion with God in this season of life?"
2. A Psalm a day.
	 > "The first psalm is the one that corresponds with the day of the month. If today is the fifteenth of the month, then your first psalm would be Psalm 15. On the fifteenth day of the month you start with the fifteenth psalm. To get your second psalm, you simply add thirty. Why thirty? Because there are thirty days in the month. So thirty added to fifteen is forty-five. Thus the second psalm you would scan on the fifteenth of the month would be Psalm 45. After that you just keep adding thirty until you get your five psalms. So thirty added to Psalm 45 takes you to Psalm 75, and thirty more to Psalm 105, and then thirty more to Psalm 135. So on the fifteenth of the month the Psalms of the Day are 15; 45; 75; 105; and 135. Those five psalms are the Psalms of the Day on the fifteenth of every month. So on the fifteenth day of this month, next month, and the month after that, you take thirty seconds to scan Psalms 15; 45; 75; 105; and 135, and then pick one of those five as the psalm you pray through. What psalm do you use on the thirty-first of a month? That’s when you pray through part (or all if you have time!) of Psalm 119."

3. A Proverb a day.
    - There are 31 chapters in Proverbs and 31 days in a month (thank you God!).
    - Read through the chapter of Proverbs that corresponds to the date (on Jan. 16, read Prov. 16).
    - Pick out one proverb (often it's just one verse) to help you along the pathway you found in scripture for your sword card.

## How can I take my devo with me into the rest of my day?

**Use a *sword card!*** 

**What's a sword card?!**

A "Sword Card" is a way to take the insights God gave you in your devotion time with you the rest of the day. 

It's a small slip of paper with five prompts (that conveniently start with "P") designed to help you summarize your devotional findings to walk with God through the rest of the day. 

As you meditate over your daily Bible reading, write at least a paragraph from each prompt (praise, promise, etc.). This will focus your reading and give you notes to look back on.

Carry the paper in your pocket next to your phone, so when you reach for your phone, you can grab the paper instead!

Use them to start spiritual conversations with each other, "Sword fight! What's your praise today?"

- **Praise:** What has God shown you about yourself that you think is amazing?
- **Promise**: What has God promised to do for you that is encouraging?
- **Pathway**: What is the way God has shown you to go/live like?
- **Prayer**: What do you want God to do for you?
- **Proverb**: How has God instructed you to walk on that path?

[Here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16EW3QQ4kLRb008I3RAbeRypjvKrPaFN2/view?usp=sharing) a pdf template for you to download.

**Suggestion:** Keep your sword cards for dry seasons when you need need to look at the promises of God to you or when your heart is cold and you need help to praise. They'll serve as a library of the goodness of God in Scripture that you've already seen.

## Original Language Bonus Time

If you've learned Greek or Hebrew and are working to keep them up, give yourself an extra half hour before you begin.

| Time   | Description         |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| 10 min | flashcards of vocab |
| 20 min | understand grammar of passage for the morning. Work at it until you can read it out loud in the original language and understand what you are saying.                     |

Now start with the **"Reading"** step above. Having understood the original language, push into the meaning of the text in order to worship God. Keep using the original language in your study.
