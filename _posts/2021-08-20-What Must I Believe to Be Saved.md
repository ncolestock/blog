# What Must I Believe to be Saved?

## God is the Creator and King

God made everything and rightfully rules over it. 

## I want to have a relationship with God

I was created in God's image to know and love God.

## I've rebelled against God

Instead of knowing and loving God like I was made for, I've purposefully done wrong things that God hates.

## I deserve God's wrath

Rom 3:23

Since I've rebelled against God, I don't deserve for God to be nice to me. I deserve for God to punish me.  

## Jesus is God who became Human

John 1:14

Jesus is fully God who became fully human.

## Jesus died in my place

Rom 3:24–25

I deserved death, but Jesus took my spot.

## Jesus rose from the dead

Acts 3:15

Jesus didn't stay dead, but paid my penalty in full and put it away forever.

## I am saved by grace through faith, not by works

Eph. 2:8–9

I can't ever deserve God's salvation, but he's offering it for free to me. I can't be a good enough person, and God isn't asking me to be. He's offering me a free gift I could never afford if I entrust myself to him completely.

## I've counted the cost and consider Jesus supreme

Luke 14:25–33

I want to know and love God more than I want anything else.
