# Lessons Learned Post-Constantine on the Role of Religious Liberty in Society

**Post-Constantine the name of Christ was dishonored by a heavy-handed state** that auspiciously sought to take every "opportunity of sinning...from the wicked."[^20210913114240] 

A Christian nationalism took root in the **population** that resulted in horrific events like [[Socrates Scholasticus, “The Murder of Hypatia”|the murder of Hytpatia]]. Christians sometimes acted as brutal and immoral as their Roman oppressors had been to them. When Christians became the powerful majority and had the coercive power of the state behind them, they began to wield the state's sword to oblige everyone to "worship" God. 

**Emperors** used the power at their disposal to make it a disadvantage to *not* be a Christian. They afforded opprotunity to worship *only* to Christians, and not to Jews and pagans.[^20210913115038] Those who worshiped according to other religions were fined and had their property confiscated.[^20210913115147] They even went so far as to kill pagans who sacrificed to their gods.[^20210913115242]

[^20210913115147]: [[Codex Theodosianus (438)]], XVI.v1, XVI.v.iii

[^20210913115038]: [[Codex Theodosianus (438)]], XVI.v1, "the privileges which are bestowed for the cultivation of religion should be given only to followers of the Catholic faith."

**Clergy** came to hold power over the state and the church began to interfere in legislation, as was the case between Ambrose and Theodosius.[^20210913115331] 

[^20210913115331]: [[Ecclesiastical History, Book V (Theodoret).pdf]], ch. 17

[^20210913114240]: [[Codex Theodosianus (438)]] XVI.x.4

All of these ills are warnings that require the student of history to see the importance of **religious toleration** in every society. The world in 2021 is an incredible example of many ways to reduce religious toleration. The progressive left in America views religious liberty as a tool of oppression (because of history like I've outlined above).[^20210913120004] The totalitarian Chinese government is wiping out the Uyghur Muslim ethnic-religious minority.[^20210913120122] The Taliban's goal is an Islamic state inherently opposed to other religions.[^20210913120303] All of these share a common thread: **governmental power used to coerce or punish the beliefs of those under its power**.

Christians believe history will one day end with a glorious monarchy where "every knee will bow and every tongue confess Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father" (Phil. 2:11). God past plan in the word was the rule through the Israelite theocracy. In the present day, why should Christians be opposed to a government's attempt to legislate religion? Or should they?[^20210913120809] 

The Bible contains many principles that lead us toward religious tolerance:
- **The Golden Rule (Matt. 7:12):** Since Christian want the freedom to exercise their religion without persecution, they should offer the same opportunity to others.
- **Assumption of Darkness (Tit. 3:3, Rom. 1:1:21–2:5):** Christians should never be surprised that the world is antagonistic toward God.
- **Few find the way (Matt. 7:14):** Few will find the way to God, and so governments doing God bidding (Rom. 13:1–7) will be composed of mostly non-Christian people. 

In summary, Christians should look forward to the monarchy of Christ, excited to live in a kingdom where justice reigns and God is always honored. Until then, we should afford all men the privileges that we want to enjoy from our government—especially freedom of religion and pray for the populace and rulers who are still separated from God.
